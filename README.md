# Spam-Email-Classification

It involves identifying and categorizing incoming emails as either spam or non-spam. Spam emails can also be dangerous. It can include malicious links that can infect your computer with malware or phishing attacks.

# Importance and relevance of spam email classification in the field of artificial intelligence


•	Spam email classification is a real-world problem that significantly impacts people's lives. Spam emails can be annoying and time-consuming to deal with, and they can also be used to spread malware and phishing attacks. 


•	Spam email classification is a challenging problem that requires the use of advanced AI techniques. This makes it a good area for research and development in AI. Spam email classification can be used to improve the performance of other AI applications. For example, spam email classification can be used to improve the accuracy of natural language processing (NLP) models.


# The specific objectives of the project are to: 


•	Identify the key machine learning techniques that are used for cyber security. 


•	Evaluate the effectiveness of these techniques in detecting and preventing cyber-attacks. 


•	Identify the challenges and limitations of using machine learning for cyber security.




# The key findings of the project are as follows: 


•	Machine learning is a promising technology for improving cyber security.


•	Machine learning techniques can be used to detect and prevent a variety of cyber attacks, including intrusions, malware, and spam. 


•	However, there are a number of challenges and limitations to using machine learning for cyber security, including data availability, data quality, adversarial attacks, and bias


# The conclusions of the project are as follows:
•	Machine learning is a valuable tool for cyber security, but it is not a silver bullet.


•	Organizations that are considering using machine learning for cyber security need to be aware of the challenges and limitations of this technology. 


•	More research is needed to address the challenges and fully realize the potential of machine learning for cyber security.
